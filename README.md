# Analysing US Name Trends

The "us_names_trend" project aims to explore and analyze name trends in the United States since 1880 using a public dataset provided by the Social Security Administration. This dataset contains names from Social Security card applications for births that occurred in the United States after 1879. The analysis involves various data wrangling and data visualization techniques to gain insights into trends based on gender, the ratio of newborns based on gender, preferences in the last letter of names, and plotting trends for the top 5 most popular names in the USA.
